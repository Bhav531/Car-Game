Car Avoidance Game
Overview
The Car Avoidance Game is a simple yet exciting browser-based game where the player controls a car to avoid incoming enemy cars on a road. The game challenges the player’s reflexes and driving skills by requiring them to move their car up, down, left, or right to dodge obstacles while maintaining speed. The goal is to score as many points as possible without crashing into the enemy cars or the road boundaries.

Features
Dynamic Road and Cars: The road is continuously moving, and enemy cars spawn at random intervals, coming towards the player.
User-controlled Car: The player's car can be moved using arrow keys or the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys for up, left, down, and right movements respectively.
Score Tracking: The player’s score increases over time as they successfully avoid collisions with enemy cars. The score is displayed at the top of the screen.
Game Over Mechanism: The game ends when the player's car collides with an enemy car or goes off the road.
Cloud Hint: A cloud with a message appears at the beginning of the game, warning the player about the possibility of breaking down if they over-rev their car.
